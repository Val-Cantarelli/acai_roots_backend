##### Technologies
Project is created with:

* Java
* Spring Boot 3.1.2
* Apache Maven(version)
* Fly.io(cloud computing plataform)



##### Design
While strategizing the project's execution and seamless integration of diverse technologies, the decision was made to establish a Cloud-based Continuous Integration environment via GitHub. This approach ensures that each application update is promptly manifested within the execution environment.

Moreover, within the realm of cloud computing, the application remains segregated through the utilization of Docker's containerization methodology.

Regarding the selection of the programming language, Java was employed alongside the Spring Framework.
##### Setup
